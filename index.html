  <h1>🎉 Happy Birthday, RABO! 🎉</h1>
  <p>mHappy Birthday, you crazy piece of my peace.
my princess, my rabo—
You’re that rare human who showed up when I didn’t even know I needed someone.
Not loud Not dramatic But real Solid Present
We’ve laughed over dumb things,
talked deep at 3 AM,
and sometimes just sat in silence that said more than words ever could.
Ur existence feels like a comfort playlist—
One that start playing  when the orld feels too much harsh for me 

On your birthday,
I don’t wish for stars or luxury or random quotes to bless you.
I wish you me 😁😁
And yes, obviously… my nonsense thoughts, dumb reels, and maybe a little chaos u enjoy.

Keep being soft asyou are.
And don’t forget:
No matter how messy life gets,
you always have me —
(Ik i have you too 😉)
the one who knows exactly how weird you are… and still choosen you every damn day.

Ik things not going well
You are mad at me 
Sorry for everything which is making u stop from talking to me 
But ik we will go through anything which comes in way as we always used to be 
( And if If you even have the thought that I forgot your birthday, take my virtual slap 👋🏻😒)

Happy Birthday idiot!! 🎉 
You have my heart🎂</p>
